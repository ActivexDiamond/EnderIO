      <title>Getting started</title>
      <p>Getting started with Ender IO isn't hard but you might want to get some mining done first. You need some iron, cobblestone,
      a furnace or three, flint and access to the bedrock layer.</p>
      <p>Start with making Flint &amp; Steel. Then go down to bedrock layer and set fire to some blocks of bedrock. It won't damage the
      bedrock---after all it is infinite---but with some luck tiny Grains of Infinity will split off.</p>

      <p>Now that you have Grains of Infinity, you can craft the first item you'll need: The Simple Machine Chassis.</p>
